# RISC-V Instructions

Instructions within a processor direct the processor on what actions to perform. Every program is comprised of a vast number of instructions, which are initially fetched, decoded, and subsequently executed to execute the program.

## Instruction Format

RISC-V instructions follow a fixed-length instruction format, making decoding and execution more efficient. The structure of a RISC-V instruction typically includes:

1. **Opcode**: The opcode field specifies the operation or action to be performed by the processor. It identifies the type of instruction and directs the processor to execute a particular operation, such as arithmetic, logical, memory access, or control flow.

2. **Operand Fields**: These fields provide additional information required by the instruction. Depending on the instruction type, operand fields may specify registers, immediate values, memory addresses, or offsets.

3. **Instruction Encoding**: RISC-V instructions are encoded using a consistent format, allowing for straightforward decoding by the processor. The fixed-length encoding simplifies instruction fetching, decoding, and execution, resulting in improved performance and efficiency.

## Example RISC-V Instructions

Here are examples of common RISC-V instructions:

- **Arithmetic Instructions**: `add`, `sub`, `mul`
- **Logical Instructions**: `and`, `or`, `xor`
- **Memory Access Instructions**: `lw` (load word), `sw` (store word)
- **Control Flow Instructions**: `beq` (branch if equal), `jal` (jump and link)


# RISC-V Instruction Types and Examples

RISC-V instructions are categorized into different types based on their format and the way they encode operands and immediate values. Here are the main instruction types in RISC-V along with examples:

## R-Type (Register Type)

- **Used for:** Arithmetic and logical operations.
- **Operands:** Two source registers and one destination register.
- **Format:**
```
funct7 [31:25] | rs2 [24:20] | rs1 [19:15] | funct3 [14:12] | rd [11:7] | opcode [6:0]
```

- **Example:** `ADD rd, rs1, rs2`

In RISC-V instructions, `funct3` and `funct7` are fields used to specify the exact operation to be performed within certain instruction types.

### Funct3

- **Purpose:** Distinguishes between different variants of operations within the same instruction type.
- **Size:** 3 bits.
- **Examples:** 
  - In R-Type instructions, `funct3` specifies specific arithmetic or logical operations (e.g., ADD, SUB, AND, OR).
  - In I-Type instructions, `funct3` differentiates between immediate arithmetic/logical operations and load/store operations (e.g., ADDI, LW, SW).
  - In S-Type instructions, `funct3` specifies the type of store operation (e.g., SB, SH, SW).
  - In B-Type instructions, `funct3` determines the branch condition type (e.g., BEQ, BNE).

### Funct7

- **Purpose:** Works in conjunction with `funct3` to further specify the operation, mainly for R-Type instructions.
- **Size:** 7 bits.
- **Examples:** 
  - In R-Type instructions, `funct7` provides additional information for operations like ADD and SUB, differentiating between addition and subtraction.

These fields are essential for correctly interpreting and executing instructions, enabling a wide range of operations within a concise instruction format.




## I-Type (Immediate Type)

- **Used for:** Operations with immediate values, load instructions.
- **Operands:** One source register, one destination register, and an immediate value.
- **Format:**


- **Example:** `ADDI rd, rs1, imm`

## S-Type (Store Type)

- **Used for:** Store instructions.
- **Operands:** Two source registers and an immediate value.
- **Format:**


- **Example:** `SW rs2, imm(rs1)`

## B-Type (Branch Type)

- **Used for:** Conditional branch instructions.
- **Operands:** Two source registers and an immediate value for the offset.
- **Format:**


- **Example:** `BEQ rs1, rs2, imm`

## U-Type (Upper Immediate Type)

- **Used for:** Instructions that involve large immediate values, such as loading the upper 20 bits.
- **Operands:** One destination register and a 20-bit immediate value.
- **Format:**


- **Example:** `LUI rd, imm`

## J-Type (Jump Type)

- **Used for:** Jump and link instructions.
- **Operands:** One destination register and an immediate value for the offset.
- **Format:**



- **Example:** `JAL rd, imm`
